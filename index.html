        <p>RC engines are engineering marvels. I am amazed at what they do, and how simple is their construction. Also, they last a long time, and generally outlive the plane on which they were mounted. Some of those engines find their way to me. I revitalize them and put them up for sale. Take a look at what I have in my inventory listed on the following pages.</p>
